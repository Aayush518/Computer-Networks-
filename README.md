# Computer Networks Semester Assignments Overview

## Assignment 1: IP Addressing and Subnetting

**Description:** Assignment 1 focused on understanding IP addressing, subnetting, and network configurations using command like `ifconfig` and tool like Packet Tracer.

- **IP Address:** 192.168.1.2
- **Subnet Mask:** 255.255.255.0 (0xffffff00 in hexadecimal)

### Key Concepts Covered:
- Explanation of subnet masks and their binary representation.
- Calculation of usable IP addresses in a subnet (28 - 2 = 254).
- Packet Tracer simulation demonstrating network configurations.

### Resources:
- [CN_ASSIGNMENT_I.pdf](CN_ASSIGNMENT_I.pdf): Theoretical overview and Packet Tracer simulation.

## Assignment 2: Introduction to Computer Networks

**Description:** Assignment 2 covered fundamental concepts in computer networks, including the OSI model, differences between OSI and TCP/IP models.

### Key Topics:
- What is Computer Networks (CN)?
- OSI model layers and their functions.
- Comparison between OSI and TCP/IP models.

### Resources:
- [CN_Assignment_2.pdf](CN_Assignment_2.pdf): Detailed explanation and diagrams.

## Ongoing Assignment: Flow of Web Traffic

**Description:** This assignment evolves throughout the semester, aiming to provide an in-depth understanding of the flow of web traffic. It will be updated periodically as new concepts are learned.

### Current Topics Explored:
- Basics of HTTP/HTTPS protocols.
- Client-server communication.
- DNS resolution process.
- TCP handshake process.
- Web server types and configurations.

### Resources:
- [Flow-of-Web.pdf](Flow-of-Web.pdf): Current overview and updates.

## Conclusion

These assignments collectively contribute to a comprehensive understanding of computer networks, combining theory with practical applications using tools and simulations.
