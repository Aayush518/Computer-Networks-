# Computer Networks Semester Assignments Overview

## Assignment 1: IP Addressing and Subnetting

**Description:** Assignment 1 focused on understanding IP addressing, subnetting, and network configurations using command like `ifconfig` and tool like Packet Tracer.

- **IP Address:** 192.168.1.2
- **Subnet Mask:** 255.255.255.0 (0xffffff00 in hexadecimal)

### Key Concepts Covered:
- Explanation of subnet masks and their binary representation.
- Calculation of usable IP addresses in a subnet (28 - 2 = 254).
- Packet Tracer simulation demonstrating network configurations.

### Resources:
- [CN_ASSIGNMENT_I.pdf](CN_ASSIGNMENT_I.pdf): Theoretical overview and Packet Tracer simulation.



## Assignment: Simulate Network Connection Using Packet Tracker

### Prerequisites
- Cisco Packet Tracer installed on your computer. You can download it from Cisco's official website.
- Basic understanding of networking concepts.

### 1. Simulating Connecting Two Hosts on the Same Network Using Packet Tracer
### Steps to reproduce
- Open Cisco Packet Tracer
- Create a new network by selecting File > New from the menu.
- From the device type selection box at the bottom, choose End Devices.
- Drag and drop one PC and one Laptop devices onto the workspace.
- Establish connection between them using a 'Copper Straight-Through' cable.
- Click on laptop
    - Go to the Desktop tab and select IP Configuration.
    - Set the IP Address to 192.168.1.2 and the Subnet Mask to 255.255.255.0.
- Repeat above step for PC, but this time set IP Address to 192.168.1.3
- To test the connectivity
    - Click on PC0.
    - Go to the Desktop tab and select Command Prompt.
    - Type ping 192.168.1.3 and press Enter.
